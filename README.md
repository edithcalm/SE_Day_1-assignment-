question 2
mastering complexity 
As software systems grew in scale, early developers faced challenges in managing complexity, leading to inefficiencies, high error rates, and system failures.
These advancements allowed developers to build larger and more reliable software systems, reducing development time and improving maintainability.

mastering process
The lack of standardized software development processes led to project delays, budget overruns, and software failures.
Software engineering shifted from rigid, linear models to flexible, iterative development processes, enabling faster product delivery and better alignment with user needs.

mastering machine 
As computing power increased and new architectures emerged, software needed to be optimized for scalability, security, and real-time processing.
Modern software engineering embraces automation, cloud-based development, and AI-driven optimizations, making software more scalable, secure, and efficient.
